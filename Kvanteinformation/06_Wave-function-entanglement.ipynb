    "## Measurement of position\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the things that might bother you when you first encounter quantum mechanics is the collapse of the spatial wave function $\\psi(x)$ (it certainly bothered me). When a particle is an a state described by the wave function $\\psi(x)$ and we measure the position, then $\\psi(x)$ collapses to a $\\delta$-function at the position $x'$ where the particle was detected. \n",
    "\n",
    "While you may be willing to accept this as just another magic thing about quantum mechanics, you still might ask yourself: how did the wave function at some point far from $x'$ know that the measurement done at $x'$ detected the particle at this point? For that to be possible the wave function must represent a highly  entangled state, such that the measurement at $x'$ can affect the rest of the wave function!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you look at the typical wave functions we find as solutions to the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in one dimension, they may not appear to represent highly entangled states at all. Consider, for example, free a particle on a ring of circumference $L$, where the ground state is just a constant (see e.g. Griffiths and Schroeter, 3ed, problem 2.46 and problem 7.41)\n",

    "Is this really a wave function of a highly entangled state such that when we measure the position and detect the particle at $x'$ then all of the wave function immediately knows that it must collapse to $\\delta(x')$? \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is yes (!) and this exercise offers a chance to understand why this true. \n",
    "\n",
    "**What:** We will set up a spatial wave function and see how a measurement of the position leads to the collapsed wave function. In doing so we will explicitly see that even the constant wave function above in fact represent a highly entangled state, and it will (hopefully) be more clear how the wave function manages to collapse when a measurement of position is performed.\n",
